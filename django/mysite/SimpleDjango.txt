Django uses what's called a Model View Controller paradigm. 
Every page you visit on a Django application is likely using these three things to serve you data.

Model: Your database abstraction, which will contain objects that are mapped to your database.

View: How you will represent the data. This is where you will actually render things to a user.

Controller: How you map URLs to views.


When someone visits the homepage, 
Django looks first at the mysite/mysite/urls.py, seeing that it points to mysite/main/urls.py, which then points to views.homepage

mysite/mysite/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path("", include('main.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
--------------------------------------------

mysite/main/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'main'  # here for namespacing of urls.

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.homepage, name="homepage"),
]


we asked urls.py to look for a homepage function, so let's define that

code changes in models.py and then

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


create object using shell
python manage.py shell

from main.models import Tutorial
from django.utils import timezone

Tutorial.objects.all()
new_tutorial = Tutorial(tutorial_title="To be", tutorial_content="or not to be.That is the question.", tutorial_published=timezone.now())
new_tutorial.save()

create an administrator user - 
python manage.py createsuperuser




python3 -m pip install django-tinymce4-lite.
