venv - virtual environment
maintaining different versions of packages for different applications, Python uses the concept of virtual environments
-  A virtual environment is a complete copy of the Python interpreter.
- system-wide Python interpreter is not affected if you install any package in environment

- Command to name virtual environment
python -m venv firstenv

- to install virtualenv package
pip install virtualenv 

- you can create a virtual environment with the following command
virtualenv firstenv

- Activate environment 
firstenv\Scripts\activate

following path refer us that firstenv is activated
(firstenv) D:\PRACS\python\Anto_Python\microblog>

-To install flask
pip install flask


First Flask Application -

In Python, a sub-directory that includes a __init__.py file is considered a package, and can be imported.
In __init__.py file, we define

app = Flask(__name__) 

- app variable is defined as an instance of class Flask.

- We pass __name__ Python predefined variable in class Flask.
This special python variable evaluates the name of the current module.
It is just a shortcut to refer the name of the package.



microblog/
  firstenv/
  firstapp/
    __init__.py
    routes.py
  microblog.py

To Run Program
set FLASK_APP=microblog.py


Using set FLASK_APP command every time you run flask app is tedious.
Instead we can register environment variables that will be automatically imported 
when you run the flask command.
To use this option you have to install the python-dotenv package
(venv) $ pip install python-dotenv


render_template - is used to return HTML pages through your Python script.

from flask import render_template

Folder name should be 'templates' where we can store all html pages

In py file import render_template and pass html page to render_template() method
render_template() converts a template into a complete HTML page i.e. rendering
The render_template() function invokes the Jinja2 template engine
Jinja2 substitutes {{ ... }} blocks with the corresponding values passed as an argument
